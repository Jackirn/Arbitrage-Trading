# Energy Trading ‚Äì Mean-Reversion Strategy on Heating Oil & Gasoil Futures

This repository presents a comprehensive analysis of **mean-reverting statistical arbitrage strategies** applied to a futures pair:  
**Heating Oil (HO)** and **Low-Sulfur Gasoil (LGO)**, using high-frequency intraday data.

The study includes:
- Data loading, filtering, and preprocessing
- Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process calibration using bootstrap methods
- Optimal trading band selection under transaction costs and stop-loss constraints
- In-sample (IS) and out-of-sample (OS) performance assessment

Two parallel implementations are provided:
- `Energy-Trading-Python/`: Complete Python pipeline
- `Energy-Trading-MATLAB/`: MATLAB modules and scripts
